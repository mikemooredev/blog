This blog is built using Jekyll, a static site generator and is currently using the default base theme, Minima. I've set it up to share code snippets, development practices and to use as a point of reference for myself in the future.

Expect posts that are straight to the point, avoiding unnecessary jargon and overly complex back stories.
